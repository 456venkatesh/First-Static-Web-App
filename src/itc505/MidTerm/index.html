	<p><b>Addendum</b></p>
	<p>Throughout the development of this interactive story, my primary goal was to create an engaging and diverse narrative with multiple branching paths leading to eight different endings. The story begins with a classic scenario: being lost in a magical forest with two possible directions to explore. Each choice unfolds into a unique adventure, offering players a range of experiences.</p>

<p>I employed a modular structure using JavaScript objects to represent each stage of the story. Each stage object contains properties such as 'text' for narrative content, 'choices' for available actions, 'nextStage' to define consequences, and 'image' for visual elements. This modular approach allowed for easy scalability and maintenance.</p>

<p>The creative choices in designing different storylines aimed to cater to various preferences, providing players with a mix of magical encounters, mysterious caves, enchanted lakes, and unexpected twists. Incorporating elements like dragons, mermaids, lions, and even a mysterious girl added diversity to the narrative, ensuring a captivating experience for the audience.</p>

<p>Challenges arose in maintaining a coherent flow while offering distinct paths. Balancing the narrative complexity to ensure each ending felt meaningful without becoming convoluted required careful consideration. Debugging was crucial to guarantee that players could seamlessly progress through the story without encountering unexpected issues.</p>

<p>Insights gained during this process include a deeper understanding of structuring interactive narratives and the importance of maintaining a balance between complexity and accessibility. The project emphasized the significance of clear decision points, engaging content, and visually appealing elements to enhance the overall user experience.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the project successfully combines storytelling with interactive elements, offering players a dynamic and entertaining journey through the magical forest. The diverse endings provide replay value, encouraging users to explore different paths and experience the multitude of outcomes.</p>
